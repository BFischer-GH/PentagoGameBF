<h1>Lab 15: Arrays</h1>
<h2>Groupings of Variable</h2>
<h3>How Do Arrays Function?</h3>

<p>Let's start learning about arrays. Arrays are essentially groupings of variables. They allow multiple variables of the same type to be stored easily.
There are two ways to make an array. We can initialize it and give it all the variables we need to store, or initialize it by specifying the length of the array. This is by far the more common method since it is more modular.
</p>

<p>The first way of making an array is shown to you. Let's demonstrate the second way. Here is the syntax.<code>int[] name = new int[length]</code> The variable type can be changed to whatever you want.
</p>

<p>Another important thing about arrays is to set and get values, we need to specify which part of the array to get and set from. Imagine that each value in the array is given a number from 0 to length-1. This is called index based,
because the numbering starts at 0. Try making an integer array with the length of 3 using the second method. Then set the 3 values to whatever you want using: <code>arrayName[index] = value;</code></p>

<p>Use print statements to test out your code. Now for the lab. We want you to first make a Scanner object, and take in an integer input which details the length of the array. Use this number to make an array the same length, then fill the array with numbers in ascending order starting from 0. Then print it out. For example, if the user types in 5, an array like this {0,1,2,3,4,5} should be made and printed out.</p>

<p>Here is a hint: You can use the variable in a for loop as an iterator for arrays. This is a very common practice amongst programmers. Remember to ask us for help or join the breakout group if you need it.</p>
