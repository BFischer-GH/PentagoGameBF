<h1>Lab 12: Loops</h1>
<h2>Loop Syntax</h2>
<h3>How Do We Write Loops?</h3>

<p>Let's learn about loops. Loops in Java is code that repeats itself over and over again. There are four main types of loops
    here, but 2 main ones. Let's learn about these 2 first.</p>

<p>First, a for loop. These are loops used when you know exactly how long you want your loop to last. Here is the syntax:
<code>for(int name = 0; name < 10; name++){}</code> Type this in your main method. Make sure to format it correctly.</p>

<p>This looks a bit daunting at first, but let's go through each part of it.</p>
<ul>
    <li>First, for signifies that the the type of loop is a for loop.</li>
    <li>Next, we initialize the iterating variable. If this is initialized earlier, you don't need the int.
    Also, this can be set to anything, but 0 is the norm since it let's us iterate through arrays, which we will learn about later.</li>
    <li>Next, we have a condition. Notice that a semicolon separates the two statements. This is because they are each their own Java statements, in their own right.
    This is what java checks for each time the loop is run. It needs to have a <,>,<=, or >=, but the value being compared can be anything. In this case, it is 10, for the program to loop 10 times.</li>
    <li>Lastly, we have the iterator, which makes the variable move up or down, usually in one step increments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using what you just learned, make a for loop that prints out the numbers 0-9 using only a single print statement. As a hint, realize that you can use the variable you made in the for loop arguments in the body of the for loop itself.</p>

<p>If that worked, you can now move on to while loops. These allow you to use boolean operators to loop. The syntax is as such:<code>while(bool == true){}</code>Let's go through each part again.</p>
<ul>
    <li>While signifies to Java that we are using a while loop.</li>
    <li>Inside the parenthesis, we have the argument. In this case, it is a boolean operator. It is kind of like the argument in an if statement.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a challenge, try doing the same thing you did with the for loop with a while loop. You will need to make a variable and increment it, as well as have an if statement to check if the variable is equal to 9. Remember to ask us or join the breakout room if you need help.</p>
