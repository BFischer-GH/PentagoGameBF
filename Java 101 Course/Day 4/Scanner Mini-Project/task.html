<h1>Lab 14: Scanners</h1>
<h2>Scanners and Imports</h2>
<h3>Scanner Mini-Project</h3>

<p>It's time for a mini-project. You should have just learned about Scanner and imports, and now you will use them to make a quiz.</p>
<p>You should see a Scanner already made for you. Using this scanner, we want you to make a 5 question quiz. The questions can be anything. If the user types something into console, the quiz will move on to the next question if it right, and restart if the question is wrong. Lastly, the answers will need to be case insensitive. You will need to use string methods, loops, and Scanners. Hint: Use</p>
<ul><li>equalsIgnoreCase() - Compares two strings, ignoring case considerations - boolean</li></ul>
<p> Good Luck, and have fun! Remember to ask us for help or join the breakout room if you need it.</p>
