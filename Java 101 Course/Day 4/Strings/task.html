<h1>Lab 13: Loops</h1>
<h2>String Methods</h2>
<h3>How Do We Use Them?</h3>

<p>Strings are useful in Java since they let us store mny characters in a row, but sometimes we need more information about them. Let's learn about string methods now.</p>
<p>First, to use a string method, we need to use this syntax: <code>stringname.stringmethod</code>. For example, if
we had a string named s and a method name charAt(), it would look like this: <code>s.charAt()</code></p>
<p>charAt() is an actual string method, and it returns the character at a certain index of the string. For example, s.charAt(0) would return the character 'T'.</p>
<p>Here is a list of some basic string methods. Try using them and seeing how they work. First is the name, then a description and any arguments, then the return type.</p>
<ul>
    <li>charAt() - Returns the character at the specified index (position) - char</li>
    <li>contains() - Checks whether a string contains a sequence of characters - boolean</li>
    <li>equals() - Compares two strings. Returns true if the strings are equal, and false if not - boolean</li>
    <li>indexOf() - Returns the position of the first found occurrence of specified characters in a string - int</li>
    <li>length() - Returns the length of a specified string - int</li>
    <li>substring()	- Extracts the characters from a string, beginning at a specified start position, and through the specified number of character - String</li>
    <li>toLowerCase() - Converts a string to lower case letters	- String</li>
    <li>toUpperCase() - Converts a string to upper case letters	- String</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these are kind of tricky, so ask us if you need help. You can consider the lab completed after trying out all the methods.</p>
